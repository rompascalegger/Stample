# Stample: The Bottomless Mine

A retro pixel mining game in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No build step, no dependencies.

The look and feel come from [Dicele](../Dicele); the gameplay, items, upgrades and achievements come from RogueMiner (Unity).

## How to play

1. **Smash the rock.** Tap it to swing, hold to keep swinging. It wiggles: a swing that misses does nothing.
2. **Damage** = (strength × 10 + pickaxe × 100) ÷ hardness, ±10% plus agility, times a crit roll (0.4× up to 3.6×).
3. **Every rock** pays score (80 × dimension × luck × player power) and drops one find: common stone, uncommon mineral, rare gem, epic gem or legendary element. Luckier rocks drop better finds.
4. **Reach the goal** (400 × 1.15^level) before the rocks run out and you go a level deeper with 6 + 3 × level rocks. Out of rocks below the goal ends the run.
5. **Deeper is darker.** Every level the cage takes you 50 m down. The lamplight shrinks, all sound drops half a semitone and gains echo (an octave at most), the mine's drone, whispers and heartbeat grow, and more pairs of eyes open in the dark and turn to watch you. Rare finds make the shaft lurch and every eye go wide.
6. **Rocks come in 50 patterns and 13 kinds of stone and crystal**: boulders, slabs, chipped chunks and pebbles, banded, veined, mossy, rusted, pyrite-studded and more, with stranger ones unlocking the deeper you go. About 1 in 25 is a glittering geode, and about 1 in 100 is a **fossil**: the only place to dig up one of 100 dinosaurs in the ⚱ Archeology collection, which also sends a giant shadow dinosaur stomping across the mine. About 1 in 200 is a glowing **mushroom**: the only place to pick one of 100 real species in the 🍄 Mushroom collection, followed by a few seconds of melting colors and bending sound. Every find tumbles out of the rock, bounces on the cave floor with a sound to match (a pebble ticks, an element crashes) and flies into the bag.
7. **Combo:** every hand hit in a row adds 4% damage (up to 3×). ⛏ Auto-mine swings by itself, but slowly and without a combo. ≋ silences the mine's ambience, ♪ all sound.
8. **Style and chaos:** dead-center PERFECT hits, OVERKILL and QUICK bonuses, GOLD FEVER at a 50 combo, random cave-ins, canaries, gold veins and ghost miners, rocks that talk back, rare pet rocks, eyes you can poke, a sign you can knock down, and a few secrets (some typed, one very old) behind 8 hidden achievements.
9. **Finds, gold, upgrades and achievements are kept forever.** Sell finds in the bag (dinosaurs and mushrooms sit together under its ❓ SECRET tab); the shop's 8 upgrades (up to 100 levels each) cost gold and specific finds.
